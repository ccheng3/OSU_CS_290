This is a example file for Homework 1. 

Adding a second line to test SSH key authentication when pushing 
change to Git. 

Second line addition still required username and password b/c 
the repo's url was not switched from HTTPS to SSH. 

I have made the switch and so these lines 3 and 4 should push without need 
for username and password.
