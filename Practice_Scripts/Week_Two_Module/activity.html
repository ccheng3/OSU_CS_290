            <p>Milk production at a dairy farm was low and <em>the business was in danger</em>. The farmer had hired
                vets,
                biologists, chemists all with no success. As a final resort the farmer hired a physicist to help him
                solve the problem. After days of work the physicist told the farmer <q>I have a solution!</q>.
            <p class="dialogue">"The farmer replied <q>Great what is it?</q>
            <p class="dialogue"><q>First we must assume spherical cows on an infinite frictionless plane...</q></p>
