Google search for an explanation.

Since there's so many elements, it's not feasible to 
memorize each one so just remember what you CAN do 
with HTML and search up the exact functionalities.

- HTML tables should NOT be used for styling, that is
better done with CSS. The HTML table should only be used
for ACTUAL situations where a tabular format to display
data/information is warranted.

HTML Forms:
- Always use input labels, and especially if the web-app
will be RELEASED to the public for production-use. 
    - two big benefits to using input labels; first is 
    that it increases accessibility b/c the input element
    can now be manipulated when you click on the input
    label (really important for users with bad vision and
    those on mobile device)
        - radio buttons activated when associated label 
        is clicked, username/password input text boxes
        activated likewise. 
        - associates the input element to the label so
        a screenreader will understand what data should
        be entered.
