HTML skeleton template has shortcut key --> press exclamation mark then Tab
in a .HTML document to auto-generate

VSCode auto-format to make the doc formatted NICELY. --> go to command palette, 
search for "format document" then press enter
(control+shift+p for command palette, ctrl+shift+i to auto-format doc)

Anchor Tags:
- when adding the href hypertext link in an anchor tag, don't forget
to include the "http://" in the website name. Otherwise the link will 
look inside your local computer for the doc/file. 

Comments:
- don't memorize the HTML comment syntax, just remember the shortcut
to make a comment (ctrl + /)

Image element:
- same idea with anchor tag except the attribute name is called "src" for source.
